# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-with-Textual-Information
This study investigates the efficacy of applying conditional generative adversarial nets (NumText_CGAN) to bankruptcy prediction problems with textual data.

We show the codes for how the textual data is processed in the scripts of classifiers and numerical data, keyword extraction of tweets, and preprocessing, text summarization and CNN for 10-K. The proposed model is coded in the script of NumText_CGAN.

The data used is in the file of data. 39FV_2021June.csv is numerical data. The columns "RiskFactors" and "MDandA" of NUM10k are 10-K textual data. The column "summary" of NUMtweet is tweets data.
